"""
The file with the events has one row per event, with these format
(space separated):
timestamp (seconds relative to the contest)
username
task_id
task_shortname
action (submit|release)

Next, for submit:
comma-separated list of file paths

For token:
submission_num

All users have empty passwords.

TODO: currently only works with tasks with one file per submission
(this is a limitation of SubmitRequest).
